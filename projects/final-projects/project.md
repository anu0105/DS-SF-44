# Course Project


## Overview

The final project should represent significant original work applying data science techniques to an interesting problem. Final projects are individual attainments, but you should be talking frequently with your instructors and classmates about them.

Address a data-related problem in your professional field or a field you're interested in. Pick a subject that you're passionate about; if you're strongly interested in the subject matter it'll be more fun for you and you'll produce a better project!

To stimulate your thinking, here is an excellent list of [public data sources](public_data.md). Using public data is the most common choice. If you have access to private data, that's also an option, though you'll have to be careful about what results you can release. You are also welcome to compete in a [Kaggle competition](http://www.kaggle.com/) as your project, in which case the data will be provided to you.

You should also take a look at [past projects](../project-examples.md) from other GA Data Science students, to get a sense of the variety and scope of projects.


## Project Deliverables

You are responsible for a **project presentation**. You will deliver your presentation (including slides) during the final week of class.

Here are the components you should aim to cover in your **presentation**:

* Problem statement and hypothesis
* Description of your data set and how it was obtained
* Description of any pre-processing steps you took
* What you learned from exploring the data, including visualizations
* How you chose which features to use in your analysis
* Details of your modeling process, including how you selected your models and validated them
* Your challenges and successes
* Possible extensions or business applications of your project
* Conclusions and key learnings

Your **presentation** does not have to extensively delve into these points but it should focus on creating an engaging, clear, and informative story about your project.

You should create a GitHub repository for your project that contains the following:

* **Proposal:** any format (PDF, Markdown, etc.)
* **Presentation slides:** any format (PDF, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.)
* **Code:** commented Python scripts, and any other code you used in the project
* **Data:** data files in "raw" or "processed" format
* **Data dictionary (aka "code book"):** description of each variable, including units

If it's not possible or practical to include your entire dataset, you should link to your data source and provide a sample of the data. (GitHub has a [size limit](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/) of 100 MB per file and 1 GB per repository.) If your data is private, you can either include an "anonymized" version of your data or create a private GitHub repository or just mention you are not at liberty to release the data.

### May 24th: Final Project due and Presentations

Deliver your project presentation in class, and submit all required deliverables (slides, code, data, and data dictionary).
